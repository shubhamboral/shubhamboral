# Hey there, fellow stranger!  <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m **Shubham**, a Computer Engineering student and developer based in India.

I enjoy building things with code - automation, machine learning, and anything that feels interesting.

If an idea comes to mind, I usually try to build it.

I’m still an amateur, but I have a growing knack for learning and creating new things.
